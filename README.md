# wordle_game

A Wordle Game project on Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is like a clone of Wordle Game.

- [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

For now, only playing the game and restarting the game are completed in the project. I might continue to develop the project in the future.

## Devices

Because of using sqflite, for now, supports only Ios, Macos and Android. For more information please check sqflite pub dev page.
